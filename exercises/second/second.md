# Second exercise
## Recap
In the first exercise we created two simple webservices (one GET and one POST) and delivered a response with a message and a status back.
## Exercise
In this exercise you will create a webservice with an optional parameter. The webservice should be available with the URL `hello/<<<nameOfThePerson>>>`. The Response to this should be a greeting to the name given in the url and status 200 again.
